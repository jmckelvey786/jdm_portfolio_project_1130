# jdm_portfolio_project_1130

## Portfolio Website Page

- I wanted to create a webpage that would help demonstrate my ability to build web pages
- I wanted a place that could act as a repository for projects that I have built and a place for prosepctive employers to find those projects.
- This webpage acts as hub for my projects and as a resume for employers.
- I built this webpage from scratch and learned how to us ID tags for navigation specifically.

## Table of Contents 

The website is broken into three sections:
- Portfolio pages or icons. Direct links to my projects.
- A brief professional working history as well as coding history
- Contact information.
